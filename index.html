<h1>"The Force Awakens"</h1>
<img src="poster.jpg" />
<p>As you may know, I have not seen the movie yet. While you are a huge fan, I have no interest at all in anything related to Star Wars. I have not seen any of the Star Wars movies in the past. Everyone is always shocked by this because most people love the movies. Maybe some day I will get around to watching them but I just feel that it would not be interesting to me.</p>
<p>When everyone went to see the movie I decided to stay home. I didn't want to spend the money at the time to go to the movies, especially to see a movie that I wasn't excited about. They also went to an 8:00am showing and that was way too early.</p>
<p>I promise that I will take you to see the movie soon because I know how much it means to you. Maybe I will find out that I actually enjoy watching Star Wars.</p>
